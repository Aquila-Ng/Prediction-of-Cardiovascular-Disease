# Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease
 Successfully applied Python Programming with 6 Machine Learning Models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-means Clustering, K-Nearest Neighbour, Naïve Bayes Classifier) to clean and train Kaggle Dataset for predicting if a person suffered cardiovascular disease accurately. • Concluded that Random Forest was the ideal model with 78% prediction accuracy that was significantly correlated with critical factors (e.g., Gender, Age, Smoking Consumption, Blood Pressure)
